# Pets Shelter

Shelter is a website project, consisting of two pages with a fully responsive and interactive design.

This application is based on the following task:

- [RSSchool task, Shelter](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/tasks/shelter/shelter.md)

## Stack
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - JavaScript

## Key Features:
 - Valid semantic and adaptive layout.
 - Clean, maintainable, and readable code.
 - Styles and graphics were exported directly from Figma.
 - JavaScript used to implement key functionalities.

## Project Breakdown:

1. Shelter. Stage 1: Fixed Layout
In the first stage of the project, I implemented the main and pets pages based on the provided Figma design. The pages are optimized for a window width of 1280px and above, ensuring they match the design layout.

2. Shelter. Stage 2: Responsive Layout
In the second stage, I added responsive functionality, making the pages fully adaptive for screen widths down to 320px. This ensures:

 - The content fits perfectly on any screen size without causing horizontal scrolling.
 - At 768px and 320px, the pages maintain design accuracy according to the Figma mockups.

3. Shelter. Stage 3: Interactive Functionality
In the final stage, I implemented the following interactive features using JavaScript:

 - A burger menu for navigation on both the main and pets pages.
 - A popup modal for viewing more details about the animals on both pages.
 - An infinite slider-carousel on the main page to showcase animals.
 - Pagination on the pets page for navigating through different sets of animals.
